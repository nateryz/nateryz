# Hi, I'm Nate Ryz 👋

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Applied Mathematics at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## 🚀 My Story

* My passion for math started young, rooted in a love for patterns.
* I come from a competitive sports background, having played hockey until I was 18.
* At the 2024 Rotman International Trading Competition, I combined my analytical skills with my competitive nature. My team placed 11th out of 42 in the ETF trading case (beating teams like Princeton).
* This sparked my desire to work in the fast-paced world of quantitative finance.
* I am now conducting research in financial mathematics, focusing on derivatives pricing, while expanding my programming skills.
